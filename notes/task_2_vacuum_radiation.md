# Haus Radiation Project Plan

## Project aim

Build a first-principles computational project starting from H. A. Haus, *On the radiation from point charges* (1986), then extend it into a serious scientific machine learning project only after the forward physics is clean and validated.

The project will proceed in layers:

1. Extract the exact minimum physics from Haus.
2. Build the forward Fourier-domain source-current solver.
3. Extract the radiating part in vacuum.
4. Validate against known physical behavior and reference formulations.
5. Extend to media.
6. Formulate an inverse problem.
7. Add SciML only where it solves a real bottleneck.

The central rule is simple:

**Physics first, code second, SciML last.**

# Planning philosophy

Every task must answer five questions:

1. What physical quantity are we computing?
2. Why is it the right quantity?
3. What equation justifies it?
4. How do we implement it numerically?
5. How do we know the output matches the physics?

We do not move to a later phase unless the current phase has a clear validation target.

# Task 0.1 — Core equations from Haus

This section is the filled physics foundation extracted from the paper.

## 1. Point-charge charge density

For a point charge $q$ moving on trajectory $\mathbf r_0(t)$, the charge density is

$$
\rho(\mathbf r,t)=q\,\delta\!\left(\mathbf r-\mathbf r_0(t)\right).
$$

This says the entire charge is concentrated at the instantaneous particle position.

Here:

* $\mathbf r$ is the field point,
* $t$ is time,
* $\mathbf r_0(t)$ is the source trajectory.

This is the starting source description in real space.

---

## 2. Point-charge current density

The current density for the same moving point charge is

$$
\mathbf J(\mathbf r,t)=q\,\mathbf v(t)\,\delta\!\left(\mathbf r-\mathbf r_0(t)\right),
$$

where

$$
\mathbf v(t)=\dot{\mathbf r}_0(t).
$$

This expresses the physically obvious fact that a moving localized charge creates a localized current directed along its instantaneous velocity.

This is the source that enters the wave equation.

---

## 3. Spatial Fourier transform

Take the spatial Fourier transform of the current density:

$$
\mathbf J(\mathbf k,t)=\int d^3r\,\mathbf J(\mathbf r,t)e^{-i\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf r}.
$$

Substituting the point-charge form gives

$$
\mathbf J(\mathbf k,t)=q\,\mathbf v(t)e^{-i\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf r_0(t)}.
$$

This is the first key object in the project.

Interpretation:

* the velocity provides the current amplitude,
* the phase $e^{-i\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf r_0(t)}$ encodes the source motion in Fourier space.

This is where the trajectory enters the spectral formulation.

---

## 4. Space-time Fourier transform

Now take the time Fourier transform:

$$
\mathbf J(\mathbf k,\omega)=\int dt\,\mathbf J(\mathbf k,t)e^{i\omega t}.
$$

Using the previous result,

$$
\mathbf J(\mathbf k,\omega)=q\int dt\,\mathbf v(t)e^{-i\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf r_0(t)}e^{i\omega t}.
$$

This is the main source quantity for the project.

For 1D motion along $z$,

$$
\mathbf r_0(t)=z(t)\hat z,
\qquad
\mathbf v(t)=v(t)\hat z,
$$

so the relevant scalar component becomes

$$
J_z(k_z,\omega)=q\int dt\,v(t)e^{-ik_z z(t)}e^{i\omega t}.
$$

This is exactly what will be implemented in the first code stage.

---

## 5. Radiation / propagating-mode condition

The paper’s main physical interpretation is that radiation is associated with those Fourier components of the source that match propagating electromagnetic modes.

In vacuum, propagating electromagnetic waves satisfy

$$
k=\omega/c.
$$

So the radiating part of the source must be examined on the vacuum light cone in $(\mathbf k,\omega)$-space.

This is the spectral-selection idea at the core of the paper: not every source Fourier component becomes outgoing radiation. Only those compatible with real propagating waves do.

---

## 6. Transverse projection

Far-field radiation depends on the transverse part of the source relative to the propagation direction.

If the observation direction is $\hat{\mathbf n}$, then the transverse radiating component is

$$
\mathbf J_\perp = \hat{\mathbf n}\times(\hat{\mathbf n}\times\mathbf J).
$$

This removes the longitudinal component and keeps the part compatible with transverse electromagnetic radiation.

Physically:

* the longitudinal part does not represent outgoing transverse radiation,
* the far-field observable is built from the transverse projected current evaluated on the propagating manifold.

This is the quantity we will later use to build radiation intensity maps.

---

## 7. Constant-velocity interpretation

Consider uniform motion:

$$
\mathbf r_0(t)=\mathbf v t.
$$

Then

$$
\mathbf J(\mathbf k,\omega)=q\int dt\,\mathbf v\,e^{-i\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf v t}e^{i\omega t}.
$$

This has support where

$$
\omega=\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf v.
$$

So the source spectrum lies on that kinematic relation.

For subluminal uniform motion in vacuum, this does not meet the propagating-wave condition in the required way to produce free radiation. The source moves with the charge, but there is no synchronous coupling to freely propagating vacuum modes. That is why uniform motion in free space does not radiate in this framework.

This is one of the central physical messages of the paper.

---

## 8. Oscillatory-motion example

The paper considers an oscillatory trajectory of the form

$$
z(t)=d\sin(\omega_0 t).
$$

Then

$$
v(t)=d\omega_0\cos(\omega_0 t).
$$

Because the phase factor contains $e^{-ik_z d\sin(\omega_0 t)}$, the resulting source spectrum contains harmonic structure. In the analytic treatment, this is naturally expressed through harmonic/Bessel expansions.

Physical meaning:

* periodic motion produces discrete spectral lines,
* higher harmonics appear depending on the oscillation amplitude and geometry,
* this is the natural benchmark case for a radiating trajectory.

This gives us the second benchmark for the forward solver.

---

## 9. Medium modification

In a medium, the propagating-wave condition changes because the phase velocity differs from $c$.

In the simplest refractive-index description,

$$
k = n(\omega)\,\omega/c.
$$

This changes the spectral matching condition between the source and the allowed propagating modes.

As a result, constant-velocity motion can radiate if the phase-matching condition is satisfied. This is the spectral interpretation of Cherenkov-type radiation.

So the paper’s vacuum/media contrast is not an extra detail. It is part of the same Fourier-selection picture:

* vacuum: no radiating overlap for ordinary uniform motion,
* medium: overlap can occur.

---

## 10. Computational observables

The physics above defines the observables for later coding.

### Phase 1 observables

* $J_z(k_z,\omega)$ for 1D motion,
* heatmap of $|J_z(k_z,\omega)|$,
* line plots of $|J_z(\omega)|$ at fixed $k_z$.

### Phase 2 observables

* transverse projected current $\mathbf J_\perp$,
* radiation intensity proxy

$$
I(\omega,\hat{\mathbf n}) \propto |\mathbf J_\perp|^2,
$$

* angular radiation maps,
* frequency-resolved radiation patterns.

### Phase 4 observables

* medium-modified radiation maps,
* threshold behavior,
* Cherenkov-angle recovery,
* dispersive angular-frequency structure.

### Final project observables

* sparse observation vectors,
* recovered trajectory parameters,
* uncertainty or identifiability metrics,
* speed/accuracy tradeoff for differentiable or surrogate-assisted inversion.

# Task 0.2 preview

The next task will be to turn the above equations into a shorter derivation note in plain language, with emphasis on:

* why uniform motion in vacuum does not radiate,
* why periodic motion does,
* why a medium changes the story,
* and exactly what will be coded first.

---

# Task 1 preview

The first code task will implement only the scalar 1D source-current transform:

$$
J_z(k_z,\omega)=q\int dt\,v(t)e^{-ik_z z(t)}e^{i\omega t}.
$$

with two benchmark trajectories:

* constant velocity,
* sinusoidal motion.

The first numerical checks will be:

* ridge near $\omega=k_z v$ for constant velocity,
* harmonic peaks for sinusoidal motion.

We will not move to radiation extraction until those are correct.

# Final research target

The final serious version of the project is:

**A first-principles Fourier-domain radiation solver, grounded in Haus’s formulation, extended into a differentiable or surrogate-assisted inverse framework that recovers trajectory parameters from sparse radiation measurements.**

That is the version worth showing to a PhD professor or shaping into a publishable computational physics / SciML paper.
